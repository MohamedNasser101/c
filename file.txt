Pointers in C language are variables that store the memory address of another variable or function. They are useful for low-level memory access, dynamic memory allocation, and passing arguments by reference. Pointers are also derived data types, which means they are not built-in types like int, char, or float, but they are defined by the programmer using the existing types.

To use pointers, we need to understand three concepts: pointer declaration, pointer initialization, and pointer dereferencing.

- Pointer declaration is the process of creating a pointer variable with a specific data type. The syntax is:

`datatype *ptr;`

where `datatype` is the type of data that the pointer will point to, and `ptr` is the name of the pointer variable. For example:

`int *p;`

This declares a pointer named `p` that can point to an int variable.

- Pointer initialization is the process of assigning a memory address to a pointer variable. The syntax is:

`ptr = &var;`

where `ptr` is the name of the pointer variable, and `var` is the name of another variable whose address we want to store in the pointer. The `&` operator returns the address of a variable. For example:

`int x = 10;`
`int *p;`
`p = &x;`

This assigns the address of `x` to the pointer `p`.

- Pointer dereferencing is the process of accessing or modifying the value stored in the memory address pointed by a pointer. The syntax is:

`*ptr`

where `ptr` is the name of the pointer variable. The `*` operator returns the value stored in the address pointed by a pointer. For example:

`int x = 10;`
`int *p;`
`p = &x;`
`printf("%d", *p); // prints 10`
`*p = 20; // changes x to 20`

This prints the value of `x` using the pointer `p`, and then changes the value of `x` to 20 using the pointer `p`.

The relation between pointers and derived data types is that pointers are themselves derived data types, and they can also point to other derived data types such as arrays, structures, unions, or functions. For example:

`int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`
`int *p;`
`p = arr; // assigns the address of the first element of arr to p`
`printf("%d", *p); // prints 1`
`printf("%d", *(p+1)); // prints 2`

This declares an array named `arr`, and a pointer named `p`. The pointer `p` is initialized with the address of the first element of `arr`, which is equivalent to writing `p = &arr[0];`. Then, we can access or modify the elements of `arr` using the pointer `p`. The expression `*(p+i)` returns the value of the i-th element of `arr`, where i is an integer.
